        <h1>What is E-waste Recycling and Process of Recycling Electronic Waste</h1>
        <p>One does not need to be a regular user of electronic products to know that electronics will not last for life. So, what happens to them after they break down? Sometimes, they are left to waste away without re-use.
<br>
            Other times, these wastes are recycled. You may ask, what is e-waste recycling? What are the processes involved? What benefits are there? We have got you covered.</p>

            <h1>What Actually is E-waste Recycling?</h1>
            <p>In addressing this question, we must first consider what e-waste is. So, what is e-waste?<br>

                E-waste is short for electronic waste. That is, trash generated from broken, obsolete, and surplus electronic devices. You will also hear people refer to it as e-scraps.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Typically, these electronics often contain toxic chemicals and hazardous materials. And where you do not dispose of these electronics properly, it can cause the release of toxic substances into our environment.

                    E-waste recycling then refers to the reprocessing and re-use of these electronic wastes. It is simple.  It is a process that seeks to recover material from electronic waste. This way, you can use them in new electronic products.</p>

            <h1>Lithium-Ion Battery Recycling─Overview of Techniques and Trends</h1><br><br>
            <p>From their initial discovery in the 1970s through the awarding of the Nobel Prize in 2019, the use of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) has increased exponentially. (1−4) As the world has grown to love and depend on the power and convenience brought by LIBs, their manufacturing and disposal have increasingly become subjects of political and environmental concerns. (5,6) World reserves of lithium, cobalt, and other metals are limited and unevenly distributed, while their mining is energy and labor intensive and creates considerable pollution. (7,8) More than 70% of the world’s cobalt comes from Congo, (9) with no other country producing more than 5%. China and Mozambique produce 70% of the world’s natural graphite, an important material for anodes. (10) As a result, natural disasters, war, or resource allocation decisions may also change the availability of these materials.
                Resource scarcity and supply are particularly important due to the short device lifetime, whether from design obsolescence, “upgrades” to newer smartphone models, or, quite often, the LIB nearing the end of its own life. By most accounts, most discarded LIBs eventually are landfilled or stockpiled, contaminating the land while wasting energy and nonrenewable natural resources. As of February 2019, there were over 5.6 million electric vehicles (EVs) in the world, a 64% increase from 2018. (11) By 2040, 58% of all cars sold worldwide are anticipated to be EVs. (12) With explosive growth in EV numbers combined with the sheer sizes of their batteries (Tesla Model 3 Long Range’s battery contains 4416 cells and weighs 480 kg), (13) significant LIB waste is and will be generated every year which, if not recycled and reused, will exert massive environmental impacts and accelerate the depletion of mineral reserves. Adding to the recycling difficulty, LIBs are complicated structures comprising one of five common cathodes, an anode, electrolyte, a separator, and current collectors along with packaging components (Table 1, Table S1). The International Energy Agency, for example, estimates that electric vehicles produced in 2019 alone generated 500,000 tons of LIB waste, and the total amount of waste generated by 2040 could be as much as 8 million tons.</p> <br>

                <h4>cyan H: hydrometallurgy; red P: pyrometallurgy; black D: direct recycling).
                    In this article, we summarize and compare different LIB recycling techniques. Using data from CAS Content Collection, we analyze types of materials recycled and methods used during 2010–2021 using academic and patent literature sources. These analyses provide a holistic view of how LIB recycling is progressing in academia and industry. The benefits and challenges of LIB recycling from economic and environmental perspectives are also discussed. Finally, we provide a global overview of established and planned recycling facilities and their reported capacities.</h4>

                        <h1>Publication Trends</h1>
                        <p>The CAS Content Collection is the world’s largest repository of chemistry-related information and is particularly useful for quantitative analysis of publications against variables such as time, country, and research area, as well as their substance details. Here, we searched for publications related to LIB recycling (see Supporting Information (SI) for full methods and limitations). A pool of 3596 documents were analyzed based on their publication type and publication year (Figure 1). While the global scientific publication volume has been steadily increasing in the past decade, we found that the annual volume growth in publication on this topic (32%) far exceeds that of overall scientific publications (4% annually), (19) suggesting an emerging interest in recycling, especially in the last 4 years. We also found that patent applications account for 74% of the Li-ion battery recycling literature, whereas patents are outnumbered by journal articles 2:1 in the entire CAS Content Collection, showing the high commercial value of technologies and discoveries around LIB recycling. An analysis of the countries/regions associated with the affiliated organization of these documents shows that China has the highest publication volumes by far in both journals and patents (Figure S1). A further analysis of patent assignees revealed the top organizations by volume of patent applications on LIB recycling (Table S2) are primarily located in China, Japan, and France.</p><br>

                        <p>Due to the complex structure and number of materials in LIBs, they must be subjected to a variety of processes prior to reuse/recycling. LIBs must be first classified and most often pretreated through discharge or inactivation, disassembly, and separation after which they can be subjected to direct recycling, pyrometallurgy, hydrometallurgy, or a combination of methods, as shown in Figure </p>

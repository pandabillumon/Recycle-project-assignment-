        <h1>Lithium-ion battery</h1>
        <p>A lithium-ion or Li-ion battery is a type of rechargeable battery which uses the reversible reduction of
            lithium ions to store energy. The anode (negative electrode) of a conventional lithium-ion cell is typically
            graphite made from carbon. The cathode (positive electrode) is typically a metal oxide. The electrolyte is
            typically a lithium salt in an organic solvent.

            It is the predominant battery type used in portable consumer electronics and electric vehicles. It also sees
            significant use for grid-scale energy storage and military and aerospace applications. Compared to other
            rechargeable battery technologies, Li-ion batteries have high energy densities, low self-discharge, and no
            memory effect (although a small memory effect reported in LFP cells has been traced to poorly made cells).

            Chemistry, performance, cost, and safety characteristics vary across types of lithium-ion batteries. Most
            commercial Li-ion cells use intercalation compounds as active materials. The anode or negative electrode is
            usually graphite, although silicon-carbon is also being increasingly used. Cells can be manufactured to
            prioritize either energy or power density.Handheld electronics mostly use lithium polymer batteries (with a
            polymer gel as electrolyte), a lithium cobalt oxide (LiCoO
            2) cathode material, and a graphite anode, which together offer a high energy density. Lithium iron
            phosphate (LiFePO
            4), lithium manganese oxide (LiMn
            2O
            4 spinel, or Li
            2MnO
            3-based lithium rich layered materials, LMR-NMC), and lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxide (LiNiMnCoO
            2 or NMC) may offer longer lives and may have better rate capability. NMC and its derivatives are widely
            used in the electrification of transport, one of the main technologies (combined with renewable energy) for
            reducing greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles.

            M. Stanley Whittingham discovered the concept of intercalation electrodes in the 1970s and created the first
            rechargeable lithium-ion battery, which was based on a titanium disulfide anode and a lithium-aluminum
            cathode, although it suffered from safety issues and was never commercialized.[17] John Goodenough expanded
            on this work in 1980 by using lithium cobalt oxide as a cathode.[18] The first prototype of the modern
            Li-ion battery, which uses a carbonaceous anode rather than lithium metal, was developed by Akira Yoshino in
            1985, which was commercialized by a Sony and Asahi Kasei team led by Yoshio Nishi in 1991.

            Lithium-ion batteries can be a safety hazard if not properly engineered and manufactured since cells have
            flammable electrolytes and if damaged or incorrectly charged, can lead to explosions and fires. Much
            development has made progress in manufacturing safe lithium-ion batteries.[20] Lithium ion all solid state
            batteries are being developed to eliminate the flammable electrolyte. Improperly recycled batteries can
            create toxic waste, especially from toxic metals and are at risk of fire. Moreover, both lithium and other
            key strategic minerals used in batteries have significant issues at extraction, with lithium being water
            intensive in often arid regions and other minerals often being conflict minerals such as cobalt. Both
            environmental issues have encouraged some researchers to improve mineral efficiency and alternatives such as
            iron-air batteries.

            Research areas for lithium-ion batteries include extending lifetime, increasing energy density, improving
            safety, reducing cost, and increasing charging speed, among others. Research has been under way in the area
            of non-flammable electrolytes as a pathway to increased safety based on the flammability and volatility of
            the organic solvents used in the typical electrolyte. Strategies include aqueous lithium-ion batteries,
            ceramic solid electrolytes, polymer electrolytes, ionic liquids, and heavily fluorinated systems.</p>
        <div class="history">
            <h1>History</h1>
            <p>Research on rechargeable Li-ion batteries dates to the 1960s; one of the earliest examples is a CuF
                2/Li battery developed by NASA in 1965. The breakthrough that produced the earliest form of the modern
                Li-ion battery was made by British chemist M. Stanley Whittingham in 1974, who first used titanium
                disulfide (TiS
                2) as a cathode material, which has a layered structure that can take in lithium ions without
                significant changes to its crystal structure. Exxon tried to commercialize this battery in the late
                1970s, but found the synthesis expensive and complex, as TiS
                2 is sensitive to moisture and releases toxic H
                2S gas on contact with water. More prohibitively, the batteries were also prone to spontaneously catch
                fire due to the presence of metallic lithium in the cells. For this, and other reasons, Exxon
                discontinued the development of Whittingham's lithium-titanium disulfide battery</p><br>
            <p>In 1980 working in separate groups Ned A. Godshall et al., and, shortly thereafter, Koichi Mizushima and
                John B. Goodenough, after testing a range of alternative materials, replaced TiS
                2 with lithium cobalt oxide (LiCoO
                2, or LCO), which has a similar layered structure but offers a higher voltage and is much more stable in
                air. This material would later be used in the first commercial Li-ion battery, although it did not, on
                its own, resolve the persistent issue of flammability. The same year, Rachid Yazami demonstrated the
                reversible electrochemical intercalation of lithium in graphite,and invented the lithium graphite
                electrode (anode)</p>
            <br>
            <p>These early attempts to develop rechargeable Li-ion batteries used lithium metal anodes, which were
                ultimately abandoned due to safety concerns, as lithium metal is unstable and prone to dendrite
                formation, which can cause short-circuiting. The eventual solution was to use an intercalation anode,
                similar to that used for the cathode, which prevents the formation of lithium metal during battery
                charging. A variety of anode materials were studied; in 1987, Akira Yoshino patented what would become
                the first commercial lithium-ion battery using an anode of "soft carbon" (a charcoal-like material)
                along with Goodenough's previously reported LCO cathode and a carbonate ester-based electrolyte. In
                1991, using Yoshino's design, Sony began producing and selling the world's first rechargeable
                lithium-ion batteries. The following year, a joint venture between Toshiba and Asashi Kasei Co. also
                released their lithium-ion battery.</p>
            <p>Significant improvements in energy density were achieved in the 1990s by replacing the soft carbon anode
                first with hard carbon and later with graphite, a concept originally proposed by JÃ¼rgen Otto Besenhard
                in 1974 but considered unfeasible due to unresolved incompatibilities with the electrolytes then in use
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>In 2010, global lithium-ion battery production capacity was 20 gigawatt-hours. By 2016, it was 28
                GWh, with 16.4 GWh in China. Global production capacity was 767 GWh in 2020, with China accounting
                for 75%. Production in 2021 is estimated by various sources to be between 200 and 600 GWh, and
                predictions for 2023 range from 400 to 1,100 GWh</p><br>
            <p>In 2012 John B. Goodenough, Rachid Yazami and Akira Yoshino received the 2012 IEEE Medal for
                Environmental and Safety Technologies for developing the lithium-ion battery; Goodenough, Whittingham,
                and Yoshino were awarded the 2019 Nobel Prize in Chemistry "for the development of lithium-ion batteries

                <p>Lithium reacts vigorously with water to form lithium hydroxide (LiOH) and hydrogen gas. Thus, a
                    non-aqueous electrolyte is typically used, and a sealed container rigidly excludes moisture from the
                    battery pack. The non-aqueous electrolyte is typically a mixture of organic carbonates such as
                    ethylene carbonate and propylene carbonate containing complexes of lithium ions.[45] Ethylene
                    carbonate is essential for making solid electrolyte interphase on the carbon anode, but since it is
                    solid at room temperature, a propylene carbonate solvent is added.

                    The electrolyte salt is almost always lithium hexafluorophosphate (LiPF
                    6), which combines good ionic conductivity with chemical and electrochemical stability.
                    Hexafluorophosphate is essential for passivating the aluminum current collector used for the
                    cathode. A titanium tab is ultrasonically welded to the aluminum current collector. Other salts like
                    lithium perchlorate (LiClO
                    4), lithium tetrafluoroborate (LiBF
                    4), and lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiC
                    2F
                    6NO
                    4S
                    2) are frequently used in research in tab-less coin cells, but are not usable in larger format
                    cells, often because they are not compatible with the aluminum current collector. Copper (with a
                    spot-welded nickel tab) is used as the anode current collector</p>
                <p>Current collector design and surface treatments may take various forms: foil, mesh, foam (dealloyed),
                    etched (wholly or selectively), and coated (with various materials) to improve electrical
                    characteristics.

                    Depending on materials choices, the voltage, energy density, life, and safety of a lithium-ion cell
                    can change dramatically. Current effort has been exploring the use of novel architectures using
                    nanotechnology to improve performance. Areas of interest include nano-scale electrode materials and
                    alternative electrode structures.

                    The increasing demand for batteries has led vendors and academics to focus on improving the energy
                    density, operating temperature, safety, durability, charging time, output power, elimination of
                    cobalt requirements, and cost of lithium-ion battery technology.</p>

                    <h1>Electrochemistry</h1>
                    <p>The reactants in the electrochemical reactions in a lithium-ion cell are materials of anode and
                        cathode, both of which are compounds containing lithium atoms. During discharge, an oxidation
                        half-reaction at the anode produces positively charged lithium ions and negatively charged
                        electrons. The oxidation half-reaction may also produce uncharged material that remains at the
                        anode. Lithium ions move through the electrolyte, electrons move through the external circuit,
                        and then they recombine at the cathode (together with the cathode material) in a reduction
                        half-reaction. The electrolyte and external circuit provide conductive media for lithium ions
                        and electrons, respectively, but do not partake in the electrochemical reaction. During
                        discharge, electrons flow from the negative electrode (anode) towards the positive electrode
                        (cathode) through the external circuit. The reactions during discharge lower the chemical
                        potential of the cell, so discharging transfers energy from the cell to wherever the electric
                        current dissipates its energy, mostly in the external circuit. During charging these reactions
                        and transports go in the opposite direction: electrons move from the positive electrode to the
                        negative electrode through the external circuit. To charge the cell the external circuit has to
                        provide electric energy. This energy is then stored as chemical energy in the cell (with some
                        loss, e. g. due to coulombic efficiency lower than 1) <br>

                        Both electrodes allow lithium ions to move in and out of their structures with a process called
                        insertion (intercalation) or extraction (deintercalation), respectively.</p><br>
                    <p>As the lithium ions "rock" back and forth between the two electrodes, these batteries are also
                        known as "rocking-chair batteries" or "swing batteries" (a term given by some European
                        industries).[50][51]
